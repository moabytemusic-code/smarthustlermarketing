### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **The "Helpful First" Rule**: Answer 80% of their question in your comment, then link to your tool for the remaining 20%
2. **The "Founder Story" Hook**: People love underdog stories. Share your "why I built this" journey
3. **The "Screenshot" Strategy**: Post screenshots of your analytics, user feedback, or building process
4. **The "Free Tier" Magnet**: Offer something valuable for free to build trust

**Remember**: Organic traffic is slow but sticky. These users convert better than paid traffic because they found you through value, not ads.
