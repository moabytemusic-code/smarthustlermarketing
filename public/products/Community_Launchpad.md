**Status:** Premium Asset
**License:** Personal Use Only

## Overview
How to launch a paid membership community (Skool, Circle, Discord) from zero.

## The 4-Week Launch Timeline

### Week 1: The "Beta" Whisper
*   Don't announce publicly.
*   DM your top 10 engagers: "I'm building a small group to solve X. Want in at 50% off?"
*   Goal: 5 Founding Members.

### Week 2: The Public Tease
*   Share a "Behind the Scenes" photo of the community setup.
*   "Building something special for [Target Audience]. Who wants the waitlist link?"

### Week 3: Content Seeding
*   Post 3 high-value threads in the community (even if empty).
*   Record a loom video tour of the content.

### Week 4: The Open Cart
*   Email your list.
*   Social blast.
*   Close cart after 72 hours (Scarcity is key).

## Platform Recommendations
1.  **Skool:** Best for "Course + Community" hybrid. Simple.
2.  **Discord:** Best for real-time chat/web3 vibe. Harder to manage.
3.  **Circle:** Professional, white-label feel.

## Retention Strategy
*   **Weekly Wins:** Every Friday, ask members to post one win.
*   **Monthly AMA:** Live Q&A with you.
