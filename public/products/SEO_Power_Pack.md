## 🏗 Module 1: The "Keyword Gap" Strategy

Most people target keywords that are too hard. Here is how to find the gold.

### Step 1: Find a Competitor
Find a site in your niche that is slightly smaller than the giants (The Wirecutter) but doing well.

### Step 2: Use the "Gap" Method
1.  Go to a tool like Ahrefs (or Ubersuggest for free).
2.  Plug in their domain.
3.  Look for their "Top Pages."
4.  Filter for:
    *   **Volume**: > 200
    *   **KD (Difficulty)**: < 20
    *   **Intent**: Commercial (Look for words like "Best," "Review," "Vs," "Pricing").

### Step 3: The "Skyscraper" Technique
If they have a "Top 10" list, you write a "Top 20" list. Make your content 2x better properly formatted, with better images and a video embed.

## ⚙️ Module 2: The Perfect On-Page Checklist

Before you hit publish, ensure your page checks these 10 boxes.

1.  [ ] **URL Slug**: Short and keyword-rich (e.g., `your-site.com/best-vpn-travel`).
2.  [ ] **H1 Tag**: Includes the main keyword.
3.  [ ] **First 100 Words**: Main keyword appears once naturally.

6.  [ ] **Internal Links**: Link to 2-3 other related pages on your site.
7.  [ ] **External Links**: Link to 1-2 authority sites (e.g., Wikipedia, trusted news) to show research.

9.  [ ] **Mobile Friendly**: Check specific elements on phone view.
10. [ ] **Meta Description**: Compelling copy that encourages a click (CTR is a ranking factor!).

## 🔗 Module 3: Backlink Strategy (The Hard Part)

Content is King, but Backlinks are Queen. Here is how to get them without spamming.

### Strategy 1: The "Broken Link" Method
1.  Find a resource page in your niche (e.g., "Best Gardening Resources").
2.  Use a robust link checker to find broken links on that page.
3.  Email the owner:
    > "Hey, I was reading your resources page and noticed link X is broken. I actually wrote a guide on that same topic recently that might make a good replacement. No pressure!"

### Strategy 2: HARO / Qwoted
1.  Sign up for **Connectively (formerly HARO)**.
2.  Reporters ask for expert quotes.
3.  Reply quickly with a valuable quote using your site title as your credential.
4.  Get a powerful backlink from news sites (Forbes, Business Insider, etc.).

## 📊 Module 4: Site Audit Tool (Self-Check)

Run this audit once a month.

1.  **Broken Links**: Use `Dr. Link Check` to find 404s. Fix them immediately.
2.  **Cannibalization**: Are two pages ranking for the same keyword? Merge them.
3.  **Speed**: Run PageSpeed Insights. If score < 80, install a caching plugin or optimize images.
4.  **Index bloat**: Search `site:yourdomain.com` in Google. Are junk pages (tags, categories) indexed? Noindex them.
