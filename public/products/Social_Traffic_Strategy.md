## Overview
A system to siphon traffic from trending news stories to your evergreen offers.

## The Strategy

### Step 1: Identify the Trend
*   Use Google Trends, Twitter "Explore", or TikTok Creative Center.
*   Look for "Rising" queries (+500% or Breakout).

### Step 2: The "Spin"
*   Don't just report the news. Connect it to your niche.
*   *Example:* AI releases a new feature -> "How this new AI feature changes Email Marketing forever."

### Step 3: Distribution
*   **Twitter/X:** Thread (Hook + 3 points + Link to your offer).
*   **LinkedIn:** Professional take/Opinion piece.
*   **Email:** "Did you see this?" subject line.

### Step 4: The Bridge
*   Always link the trend back to a core problem your product solves.
*   "This new update makes it harder to X, which is why our system Y is essential."
