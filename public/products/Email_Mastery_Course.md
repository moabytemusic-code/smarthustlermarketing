## 🏗 Module 1: The Foundation

### The "One Job" Rule
Every email you send should have **ONE job**.
- Get a click?
- Get a reply?
- Deliver value?
*Never try to do all three.*

### The Subject Line Formula
If they don't open, you don't exist.
1.  **Curiosity**: "The heavy box on my porch..."
2.  **Benefit**: "How to save 5 hours this week"
3.  **Scarcity**: "Closing in 2 hours"
4.  **Personal**: "Quick question regarding your [Business]"

## 🤖 Module 2: The "Welcome Sequence" (The Money Machine)

This is the most important sequence you will ever write. It sets the tone for the relationship.

### Email 1: The Delivery (Immediate)
- **Goal**: Give them the lead magnet you promised immediately.
- **Tone**: Helpful, excited.
- **Script**: "Here is the PDF you requested. Also, a quick intro about who I am..."

### Email 2: The Origin Story (Day 1)
- **Goal**: Build connection.
- **Script**: "I wasn't always a [Expert]. 3 years ago, I was broke..."
- **Hook**: Show vulnerability. People buy from humans, not corporations.

### Email 3: The "Aha!" Moment (Day 2)
- **Goal**: Shift their belief.
- **Concept**: Explain the "Big Secret" or the "New Mechanism" that makes your method work.
- **Example**: "Most people think SEO is dead. Here is why they are wrong."

### Email 4: The Soft Pitch (Day 3)
- **Goal**: Make the first offer.
- **Script**: "If you liked the free tips, you will love [Product]. It helps you do X, Y, and Z faster."

## ⚙️ Module 4: Automation & Segmentation

### Tagging 101
- **Lead**: Someone who downloaded a freebie.
- **Customer**: Someone who bought a product.
- **VIP**: Someone who bought > $100.
*Rule: Never pitch a product to someone who just bought it.*

### The Re-Engagement Workflow
If someone hasn't opened an email in 60 days:
1.  Send: "Are we still friends?"
2.  Wait 3 days.
3.  Send: "Final warning: I'm scrubbing my list."
4.  If no open -> **DELETE THEM**. (Dead leads hurt your deliverability).
