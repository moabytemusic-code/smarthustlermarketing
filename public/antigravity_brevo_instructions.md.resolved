```

## Purchase Tracking Setup

2. Connect Stripe or Gumroad

## Additional Context

**Philosophy:** This campaign follows "Give, Give, Give, Offer" but with a strategic twist:
- Days 0-7: 100% value (tools + free books)
- Days 8-14: 75% value, 25% soft sell
- Days 15-30: 50/50 (tools + offers)

**Cross-Promotion:** Integrate Smart Hustler Marketing products with Signal Engines tools throughout the sequence.

**Segmentation:** Use tags to create different paths for engaged users, buyers, and inactive subscribers.

## Questions to Ask Me If Needed

If you encounter any issues or need clarification:
1. Should I write the full email copy for each email?
2. Do you want HTML templates or plain text?
3. Should I set up A/B testing for subject lines?
4. Do you want me to create the "Buyer Nurture" sequence as well?

---

## Final Notes

This is a high-value automation that will run 24/7 once set up. Take your time to ensure:
- All links are correct
- Tags are spelled consistently
- Delays are accurate
- Email copy is compelling

Good luck! This should take about 30-45 minutes to complete.
