        <h3>Action-Based Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>At Smart Hustler Marketing, we invest deeply in the success of our students and expect the same commitment from you. Because our digital products (including "The Active Asset Blueprint" and "Founder's Operating System") provide immediate, irrevocable access to proprietary intellectual property, <strong>we do not offer "no-questions-asked" refunds.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Strict 14-Day Action-Based Guarantee:</strong><br>
        We are confident in our methods. If you do the work and do not see value, we will refund your investment. To be eligible for a refund, you must submit a request to support@smarthustlermarketing.com within 14 days of purchase. Your request MUST include proof of work, specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Completion of the Module 1 "Asset Valuation" Worksheet.</li>
            <li>Completion of the Module 2 "Niche Profitability Scorecard."</li>
            <li>Evidence of at least one implemented "Active Asset" strategy (e.g., a published landing page, live offer, or conducted market research).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refunds are <strong>NOT</strong> granted for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Change of mind" or "Mindset issues."</li>
            <li>Failure to access the potential of the course due to lack of time.</li>
            <li>Financial hardship occurring after the purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you cannot prove you did the work, no refund will be issued. We built this for builders, not tourists.</p>
