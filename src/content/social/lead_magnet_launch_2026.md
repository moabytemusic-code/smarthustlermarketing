Use these scripts to promote your new lead magnet.

## 🐦 Twitter / X Thread (The "Value" Hook)

**Tweet 1:**
Stop building "side hustles" that are just second jobs.

If you stop working and the money stops, you don't have a business. You have a boss (yourself).

Here is the 5-step blueprint we use to build automated $10k/mo income streams in 2026. 🧵👇

**Tweet 2:**
1. The Micro-Niche Discovery 🗺️

Most people fail because they go too broad.
❌ "Marketing Blog" (Too crowded)
✅ "SEO for Dentists in Florida" (High intent)

The riches are in the niches. Use AnswerThePublic to find specific pain points people are begging to solve.

**Tweet 3:**
2. The No-Code Stack 🛠️

You don't need to be a dev. You need a system.
- Traffic: Next.js or WordPress
- Bridge Page: Carrd (to capture emails)
- Engine: Brevo (to sell while you sleep)

Stop overcomplicating the tech.

3. The "Hook" 🎣

You need a Lead Magnet.
It must be:
- Fast to consume (Checklist > Ebook)
- High Value (Solve 1 specific problem)
- Instant Gratification

If it takes 2 hours to read, they won't value it.

**Tweet 5:**
4. The Content Flywheel 🔄

Stop creating unique content for every platform.
- Write 1 Blog Post.
- Turn headers into a Thread (like this).
- Screenshot for LinkedIn.
- Read script for TikTok.

Work smarter, not harder.

**Tweet 6:**
5. The Monetization Ladder 💰

Don't launch a $1k course on Day 1.
- Level 1: Affiliate Products ($0-$500/mo)
- Level 2: Digital Downloads ($500-$5k/mo)
- Level 3: Coaching/High-Ticket ($10k+/mo)

Earn the right to sell high-ticket.

**Tweet 7:**
I put the entire strategy, tools, and checklists into a free PDF.

## 💼 LinkedIn Post (The "Thought Leader" Angle)

**Headline:** Why 90% of side hustles will fail in 2026 (and how to be the 10%).

**Body:**
We need to redefine "Side Hustle."

Driving for Uber is not a hustle. It's a second job.
Freelancing on Upwork is not a hustle. It's a service business.

Real wealth comes from **Asset Creation**.

Building systems that work when you don't.

I just released my internal playbook: **The 2026 Side Hustle Blueprint**.

It breaks down the exact 5-step system I use to automate revenue:
1️⃣ **Micro-Niche Discovery** (finding the low-competition gold)
2️⃣ **The No-Code Stack** (building without a dev team)
3️⃣ **The Content Flywheel** (turning 1 hour of work into 10 pieces of content)

It’s not just theory. It’s the actual roadmap.

If you want to stop trading time for money, this is for you.
