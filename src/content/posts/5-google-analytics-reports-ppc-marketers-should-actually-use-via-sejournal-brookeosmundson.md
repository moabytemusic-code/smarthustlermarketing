# 5 Must-Use Google Analytics Reports for PPC Marketers

## The Situation

PPC marketers often drown in data but struggle to pinpoint actionable insights. A Search Engine Journal article highlights **five essential Google Analytics reports** that cut through the noise, enabling better targeting, spend justification, and visibility into how paid traffic fuels conversions across the customer journey[5]. These reports leverage GA4's predictive power and attribution models to reveal hidden patterns, like view-through conversions and high-intent audiences[1][4].

## The Breakdown

GA4 equips PPC pros with reports that go beyond clicks and impressions:

- **Audiences Report**: Demographics, interests, and behaviors help segment high-value users. Identify first-time visitors from top-of-funnel sources like display ads for refined targeting[1][4].
- **Keyword Analysis Report**: Tracks PPC keyword performance, CPC, and clicks to optimize SEO and ad strategies[4].
- **Cost Analysis Report**: Monitors campaign expenses against ROI, spotting budget leaks or high-ROAS channels[3][4].
- **Predictive Metrics (Purchase/Churn Probability)**: AI forecasts user likelihood to buy or churn, powering remarketing to 70%+ probability segments[1].
- **Attribution & Custom Reports**: Reveals multi-touch journeys, including view-through conversions where display ads influence 23% of sales without clicks[1].

Real results include 35% lower acquisition costs, 28% ROI gains, and $340K in revenue from insight-driven tweaks[1].

## Why This Matters

For business owners and entrepreneurs, these reports transform PPC from a cost center to a revenue engine. They provide transparency for stakeholders, justify ad spend with data (e.g., ROAS, CPA), and uncover opportunities like 67% conversion lifts from high-intent targeting[1][3]. In 2026's AI-driven landscape, ignoring them risks wasted budgets amid tighter attribution and predictive analytics[2][7].

## Action Plan

1. **Access Core Reports**: Dive into Audiences, Keyword Analysis, and Cost Analysis in GA4 to baseline PPC performance[4][5].
2. **Enable Predictive Audiences**: Segment users by purchase probability and launch remarketing campaigns for 2.4x higher intent traffic[1].
3. **Build Custom Attribution Reports**: Track view-through conversions and multi-channel paths to reallocate 40% of budget effectively[1].
4. **Monitor Key Metrics Weekly**: Focus on CTR, CPA, ROAS, and churn probability; adjust bids on high-ROAS sources[3].
5. **Test & Iterate**: A/B test audiences from reports, aiming for 30%+ efficiency gains in 60 days[1].
