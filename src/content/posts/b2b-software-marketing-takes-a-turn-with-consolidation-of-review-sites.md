# G2's Mega Acquisition: B2B Marketing Shift

## The Situation

G2 has acquired Software Advice, Capterra, and GetApp from Gartner, consolidating major B2B software review platforms into one powerhouse.[1][2] This deal unites fragmented markets, reaching over **200 million annual software buyers** and aggregating nearly **6 million verified reviews** across 2,000+ categories.[1][2] Expected to close in Q1 2026, it positions G2 as the dominant player amid AI-driven search shifts and changing buyer behaviors.[1][2]

## The Breakdown

Gartner's Digital Markets (acquired Software Advice in 2014) operated as a lead-gen media business, contrasting its core research services, leading to this divestiture amid modest Q3 2025 revenue growth and stock pressures.[1][2] G2 now controls complementary audiences: its enterprise focus pairs with Capterra's SMB reach, enabling combined **intent data** for 3x more buyer signals and new pay-per-lead models.[2]

Remaining competitors include TrustRadius (acquired by HG Insights in 2025) and PeerSpot (enterprise-focused).[1] Concerns arise over market concentration, potential FTC scrutiny, higher vendor costs, and review authenticity in pay-to-play ecosystems.[2] Broader trends show B2B SaaS consolidating due to tool overload—CMOs use 10+ data sources, with workers toggling apps 1,200 times daily.[3]

Market data: B2B review platforms projected to grow from $420M in 2025 to $577M by 2032 (5.7% CAGR).[4] **86% of buyers** rely on third-party reviews.[6]

## Why This Matters

For B2B software marketers and entrepreneurs, this shifts **intent data strategies**—G2's scale means centralized buyer journeys, reducing fragmentation but increasing dependence on one platform.[1][2] Smaller vendors face steeper ad costs and visibility challenges; pipelines reliant on these sites risk disruption from pricing hikes or AI-optimized "Answer Engine Optimization" (AEO).[2]

Buyers bypass traditional search via AI prompts, Reddit, and LinkedIn, amplifying review sites' early-funnel role while tech-stack consolidation demands efficient tools.[1][3] Missing this could mean lost leads in a market where **86%** of purchases hinge on peer reviews.[6]

## Action Plan

- **Audit your review site investments**: Assess spend across G2, Capterra, etc., and consolidate to leverage combined intent data for better ROI.[1][2]
- **Diversify intent sources**: Supplement with Reddit, LinkedIn, and direct channels to hedge against G2 dominance and AI shifts.[1]
- **Optimize for AEO**: Craft content for AI/LLM visibility, focusing on authentic reviews to rank in answer engines.[2]
- **Encourage verified reviews**: Incentivize genuine feedback ethically to boost signals amid authenticity concerns.[2]
- **Streamline your tech stack**: Cut redundant tools (average 10+ data sources) to match buyer consolidation trends and cut toggle tax.[3]
