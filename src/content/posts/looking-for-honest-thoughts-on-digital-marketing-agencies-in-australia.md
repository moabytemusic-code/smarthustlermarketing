### 🚨 Breaking News in Marketing

**Source:** [Looking for honest thoughts on digital marketing agencies in Australia?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/1pwws94/looking_for_honest_thoughts_on_digital_marketing/)

Hey folks, I’ve been doing some digging and came across Clutch’s list of top digital marketing agencies in Australia — they’ve got a whole directory of verified reviews & rankings for agencies across SEO, PPC, social media, web design, etc. which looks like a good starting point if you’re scouting for one. 
 For example, the ranking shows agencies like SEONotion, Pure Bold, Clearwater Agency, Soup Agency, Luminary, and a bunch more with detailed client feedback & verified projects. You can filter by services, hourly rates & client reviews, which is kinda helpful compared to just scrolling agency sites. 
 Questions for the community:
  
Have you actually used this Clutch list to hire an Aussie agency?
 Did it help you find a good fit, or did it feel like a pay‑to‑play directory where big spenders rank higher?
 Any agencies you’d personally recommend (or avoid) based on real results — especially for SEO, ads or full digital strategy?
  
I also saw some Reddit threads where people had mixed experiences with Clutch — some folks said they got solid leads from it, while others thought the quality dropped or the platform became expensive/less useful over time. 
 Would love to hear real user experiences here before I reach out to a few prospects. Cheers!
