# Entity Linking: Local SEO Game-Changer for Multi-Location Brands

Entity linking provides semantic clarity to search engines and AI, dramatically improving local rankings and non-branded visibility for businesses like Brightview Senior Living with 47+ locations.[1]

## The Situation

Search has evolved beyond keywords to semantic understanding, where engines identify entities (locations, services, people) and their relationships for accurate results, especially in AI-driven environments.[1] Multi-location brands face challenges: search engines often misinterpret place names or services, serving wrong pages for "near-me" queries.[1] Brightview Senior Living, with over 47 locations, shifted from keyword-first to entity-first SEO to scale across markets and add clarity for AI systems.[1]

## The Breakdown

Brightview implemented **place-based and topical entity linking** by connecting content entities to authoritative external sources via schema markup, reducing ambiguity.[1] This was scaled across community pages, blogs, and resources, building a knowledge graph of locations and services.[1]

**Key results:**
- 25% increase in clicks and 30% in impressions for non-branded "assisted living" queries.[1]
- 16% YoY click growth and 26% impression growth on community pages, defying industry declines.[1]

Entity linking clarifies what each page represents, boosting performance in geo-modified and high-intent searches.[1] In 2026, this aligns with trends favoring entity trust over keywords in AI search.[5][9]

## Why This Matters

For business owners and marketers with multiple locations, entity linking builds **E-E-A-T** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), essential for local pack rankings and AI summaries.[1][2] It counters misinterpretations, enhances non-branded visibility (critical for new customer acquisition), and future-proofs against semantic/AI shifts—businesses weak in entities risk invisibility.[1][9] Multi-location brands gain scalable authority, turning content into machine-readable signals for sustained local dominance.[1]

## Action Plan

1. **Audit entities:** Identify key locations, services, and topics on your site; use schema to define properties and link to authoritative sources like Wikipedia or official directories.[1]
2. **Implement place-based linking:** On location pages, explicitly link entities to geo-specific references, clarifying service areas and offerings for near-me queries.[1]
3. **Scale across content:** Apply to blogs, FAQs, and resources; build internal connections forming a knowledge graph.[1]
4. **Track non-branded performance:** Monitor impressions/clicks for service queries pre/post-implementation using Google Search Console.[1]
5. **Combine with local signals:** Pair with citations and proximity links for compounded ranking boosts.[2]

## Toolkit Recommendation

Stop guessing which niches work. Use **Micro Niche Finder AI** to validate profitable markets in seconds, then layer entity linking for hyper-local dominance. Perfect for identifying high-ROI locations before scaling SEO efforts.
