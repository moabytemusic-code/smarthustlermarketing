### 🚨 Breaking News in Marketing

**Source:** [I have a doubt‼️](https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/1pwzd5w/i_have_a_doubt/)

I've just started doing affiliate marketing. I'm trying it on both TikTok and Reddit. On Reddit, almost all my posts get taken down, while on TikTok, people watch my videos but no one clicks on my links. I don't know how to make my affiliate business explode. Any advice is welcome, thanks.
