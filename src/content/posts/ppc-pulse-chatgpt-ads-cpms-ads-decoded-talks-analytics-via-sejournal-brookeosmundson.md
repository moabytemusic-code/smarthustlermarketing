# ChatGPT Ads: $60 CPM Shocks Marketers

## The Situation

OpenAI is launching ads in ChatGPT at a reported **$60 CPM** (cost per 1,000 impressions), triple typical Meta rates, with tests starting soon for U.S. free and $8/month Go tier users.[1][2][3] Ads appear at the bottom of relevant responses, clearly labeled, excluding sensitive topics like health or politics, while premium Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans stay ad-free.[1][3][5]

This follows OpenAI's January 2026 announcement, marking its bold entry into advertising amid rising compute costs and revenue pressures—from $2B in 2023 to projected growth.[1][5]

## The Breakdown

**Pricing Premium:** $60 CPM dwarfs Meta's ~$20, positioning ChatGPT as high-intent conversational real estate where users seek task-specific help, not passive scrolling.[1][2][3] No self-serve tools; agencies negotiate directly, with view-based (not click-based) pricing signaling focus on exposure over direct response.[4]

**Data Limitations:** Advertisers get only high-level metrics like impressions and clicks—no granular conversion tracking or demographics due to privacy pledges against selling user data.[1][2][3] This creates tension: premium prices for 'flying blind' visibility in AI chats.[2]

**Format & Rollout:** Ads tie to conversation context, with low volume to preserve trust and answer integrity. Initial sectors: travel, retail, tech; broader rollout expected in 2026.[1][5][6]

Industry reactions mix excitement for first-mover intent moments with skepticism on ROI sans detailed analytics.[1][3]

## Why This Matters

For **business owners and marketers**, ChatGPT ads redefine PPC in AI: high-attention, intent-driven environments could yield outsized brand influence, but elevated costs and opaque measurement demand experimentation over scale.[3][4] Early adopters gain proprietary insights into gen-AI performance before platforms like Google refine similar formats, potentially reshaping budgets from social feeds to conversational AI.[1][4]

Risks include overpaying for unproven lift amid OpenAI's $143B projected cash burn (2024-2029), but success could validate premium pricing for AI assistants.[1][4]

## Action Plan

1. **Monitor Launch:** Track U.S. tests starting February 2026; contact OpenAI sales or agencies for early access if your niche (travel/retail/tech) aligns.[1][4][5]

2. **Budget for Premium Tests:** Allocate 5-10% of PPC spend for $60 CPM pilots, focusing on brand awareness over conversions given data limits.[2][3]

3. **Optimize for Context:** Craft ads hyper-relevant to queries (e.g., product recs in task chats); test follow-up Q&A formats.[1][5]

4. **Diversify Metrics:** Use external tools for attribution (UTMs, pixels) and benchmark against Meta/Google baselines.[2][3]

5. **Prepare for Scale:** Build AI ad creatives now; watch for measurement expansions as OpenAI iterates.[3][4]
