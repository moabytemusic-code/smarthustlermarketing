## Why You are Broke Promoting Amazon Products

Let's do the math. To make $5,000/month promoting Amazon books (at 4% commission on a $15 book = $0.60 per sale), you need to sell **8,333 books**.

To make $5,000/month promoting a High-Ticket SaaS or Course (at 40% commission on a $2,500 product = $1,000 per sale), you only need **5 sales**.

Which sounds easier? Finding 8,000 customers or finding 5?

## The High-Ticket Triangle

Successful high-ticket affiliate marketing requires three things:

### 1. The Right Offer
Look for:
*   **Proven VSL (Video Sales Letter):** Does the product sell itself?
*   **High Gravity/Momentum:** Are others making money with it?
*   **Value Ladder:** Does it have upsells that you get paid on?

### 2. The Bridge Page
Never send traffic directly to an affiliate link. You need a **Bridge Page**.
*   **Video:** A 60-second video of YOU explaining why you recommend the product.
*   **Bonuses:** Offer your own templates, guides, or coaching as a free bonus if they buy through your link. This is the secret sauce.

### 3. Traffic Quality > Quantity
You don't need viral TikToks. You need targeted leads.
*   **YouTube Search:** "Best CRM for real estate agents 2024" (High intent)
*   **LinkedIn DM Ads:** Targeting CEO job titles directly.

## Action Steps
1.  Go to **ClickBank** or **Digistore24**.
2.  Filter by "Average Commission > $500".
3.  Build a simple Bridge Page using the tools in our Resources section.
4.  Start creating content that answers specific problems this product solves.
