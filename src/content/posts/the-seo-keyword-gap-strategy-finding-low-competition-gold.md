Stop fighting for "Make Money Online". You will lose.
The secret is finding the "Gap" – keywords that have traffic but zero quality answers.

## The Strategy
1. Go to Google.
2. Type in your niche + "for" (e.g., "CRM for...")
3. Let Autosuggest finish the sentence.
4. Look for "Low DA" sites on page 1.

If you see a Reddit thread or a Quora answer on Page 1, you have found Gold.

## Why this works
Big competitors are too lazy to write articles for "small" keywords (100 visits/mo).
But if you stack 50 of these small articles, you get 5,000 highly targeted visitors.
And these visitors convert better because their intent is specific.
