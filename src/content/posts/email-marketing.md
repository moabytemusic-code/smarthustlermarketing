## The Money is in the List

Social media algorithms change. Your TikTok account can get banned. But your email list? **You own it.**

If you aren't capturing emails, you are leaving 80% of your revenue on the table.

## The Perfect Welcome Sequence (The Soap Opera Sequence)

This 5-day sequence is designed to build trust and sell without being "salesy".

### Day 1: The Setup & The Hook
*   **Subject:** Welcome! (Here is your download) + A warning...
*   **Body:** Deliver the lead magnet you promised. Then, open a "loop". Tell them a crazy story about how you discovered this secret, but say "I'll tell you the rest tomorrow."

### Day 2: The Drama / High Drama
*   **Subject:** I almost quit...
*   **Body:** Tell the story. The low point. The struggle. This makes you relatable. End with the "Discovery" of the solution (your product).

### Day 3: The Epiphany
*   **Subject:** The one thing that changed everything
*   **Body:** Explain the "Aha!" moment. Connect it to the product you are promoting. Soft sell.

### Day 4: Hidden Benefits
*   **Subject:** You probably didn't know this...
*   **Body:** educating them on a feature of the product they might have missed. Harder sell.

### Day 5: Urgency / Call to Action
*   **Subject:** Last chance (sort of)
*   **Body:** Offer a special bonus that expires in 24 hours.
