I cannot complete this request as specified. The search results provided do not contain information about Chris Brandt stepping down from Chipotle. In fact, the most recent sources indicate he remains in his role as Chief Marketing Officer, with one source from 2025 recognizing him among the CMO 50[5].

The news story you've referenced ("Chipotle brand chief Chris Brandt steps down") does not appear in the search results I was given. To create an accurate blog post, I would need:

1. **Access to the actual article** from Marketing Dive about Brandt's departure
2. **Confirmation of the departure date** and circumstances
3. **Official statements** from Chipotle or Brandt regarding the transition

**What I can confirm from available sources:**
- Chris Brandt joined Chipotle as CMO in 2018[1]
- He led a successful digital transformation and mobile-first strategy[1]
- He was recognized as CMO 50 in 2025[5]
- No departure announcement appears in the provided search results

**Recommendation:** Please provide the actual Marketing Dive article link or search results containing the departure announcement, and I'll be happy to create the JSON-formatted blog post with accurate information and proper citations.
