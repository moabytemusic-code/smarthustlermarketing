# Internal Linking: Boost or Kill Topical Authority?

Internal linking can either reinforce your site's **topical authority** or weaken page relevance and user intent, directly impacting SEO rankings and traffic.[2][1]

## The Situation

A recent Search Engine Journal article by Helen Pollitt reveals a critical SEO truth: many sites' internal linking structures hurt rather than help **topical authority**. Internal links distribute link equity and relevance signals, but poor implementation dilutes authority by connecting unrelated pages or using generic anchor text.[2] This creates confusion for search engines, scattering authority instead of concentrating it on key topics.[1][3]

## The Breakdown

**Topical authority** emerges when search engines recognize your site as an expert on a topic through interconnected, relevant content. Internal links act as signals:

- **Relevant links strengthen authority**: Linking topically similar pages (e.g., craft hobbies to textile crafts) reinforces destination page relevance.[2]
- **Irrelevant links dilute it**: Links from unrelated pages or with generic anchors like "click here" weaken signals, dropping topical relevance scores below 75%.[2][1]
- **Key metrics to audit**:
  - 75%+ of inbound links from same-topic "family" pages.[2]
  - Anchor text relevance: Aim for 30%+ topically matched anchors out of total links.[2]
  - Link equity flow: High-authority pages should pass value to deeper content via topic clusters.[3][1]

PageRank and CheiRank distribution favors pages with quality, relevant internal links, boosting E-E-A-T signals.[3]

## Why This Matters

For business owners and entrepreneurs, weak internal linking means lost organic traffic, lower conversions, and stalled growth. Strong topical authority dominates SERPs, attracts qualified leads, and scales without endless backlink chasing. Ecommerce sites see diluted product authority; content sites lose cluster power. Fixing this unlocks compounding SEO gains, turning your site into a revenue machine.[3][2][4]

## Action Plan

1. **Audit inbound links**: Use tools to check if 75%+ come from topically relevant pages. Fix by pruning irrelevant links.[2]
2. **Optimize anchor text**: Replace generics with keyword-rich, descriptive phrases matching page intent (e.g., "keyword clustering strategy").[1][4]
3. **Build topic clusters**: Create pillar pages linking to satellites, and vice versa, with 3-5 contextual links per 1,000 words.[4][3]
4. **Prioritize high-authority sources**: Link from top-performing pages to boost underperformers; link deep, not just homepage.[1]
5. **Monitor and scale**: Track relevance scores quarterly; add evergreen links from fresh content.[3]
