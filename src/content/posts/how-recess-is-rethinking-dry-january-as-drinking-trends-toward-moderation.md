# Recess Rethinks Dry January: Moderation Over Abstinence

## The Situation

Recess, a functional beverage brand founded in 2018, is launching a bold campaign challenging the traditional Dry January push for total alcohol abstinence. Instead, it promotes **moderation and balance**, positioning its mood-boosting mocktails and sparkling waters as everyday alternatives—like weeknight wind-downs or social mocktails—rather than strict non-alcoholic substitutes.[2][3]

The campaign kicked off in early January with a full-page New York Times ad on "Quitter’s Day" (January 11), featuring founder Ben Witte’s manifesto: “Perfection is a terrible New Year’s Resolution” and “You’re not broken. You don’t need a new you.” It spans out-of-home ads in New York, influencer partnerships, in-person activations, and print, created with agency Better Half.[1][3]

## The Breakdown

Recess blends sparkling water with adaptogens like ashwagandha and L-theanine for stress relief and mental clarity, evolving from CBD-infused drinks to **Mood beverages** and **Zero Proof craft mocktails**. This taps into the booming functional beverage market, projected to hit $208 billion globally by 2026.[1]

Key stats and shifts:
- Consumers increasingly favor moderation over sobriety; Recess targets those sipping NA drinks between alcohols or instead of wine.[2]
- Dry January participation wanes mid-month, aligning with the campaign’s Quitter’s Day timing.[3]
- Broader trends show drinking less year-round, blurring lines with recovery drinks via adaptogens and nootropics.[4]

Recess differentiates by avoiding “drink me instead of alcohol” pitches from rivals like Athletic Brewing or Seedlip, emphasizing equilibrium in a world of extremes.[2][3]

## Why This Matters

For business owners and marketers, Recess exemplifies seizing cultural shifts: wellness culture demands **balance branding** over rigid resolutions. In a $208B functional beverage space, small brands win via authentic positioning, community engagement, influencers, and sustainability—like Recess’s recyclable packaging.[1]

Entrepreneurs gain by mirroring this: pivot from one-off trends (e.g., Dry January) to year-round habits. It builds loyalty in moderation markets, where sales data favors ongoing use over seasonal abstinence, offering scalable growth in competitive niches.[2]

## Action Plan

1. **Audit your positioning**: Analyze customer data to shift from extreme promises to balanced benefits—e.g., “everyday calm” vs. “total detox.” Test via surveys.[2][3]

2. **Time campaigns strategically**: Launch around cultural pivots like Quitter’s Day with multi-channel ads (print, OOH, influencers) for maximum reach.[3]

3. **Diversify products**: Offer versatile SKUs for occasions (wind-downs, socials) to capture broader moderation demand, backed by adaptogens or functionals.[1][4]

4. **Build community authenticity**: Partner with wellness influencers and encourage UGC on social for organic amplification and loyalty.[1]

5. **Validate distribution**: Prioritize DTC online sales alongside health-focused retail for accessibility and visibility.[1]
