# Puma’s Brand Shake-Up: What Founders and CMOs Must Learn

## The Situation

Puma has appointed **Nadia Kokni** as **vice president, global brand marketing**, making her the company’s most senior global marketing leader, effective January 1, 2026.[3][5] She reports directly to **Chief Brand Officer Maria Valdes**, reflecting a deliberate move to centralize and elevate brand leadership.[3][5]

This move follows a major internal **reorganization** in which Puma combined **brand marketing, product, creative direction, innovation and go-to-market** into a **single global organization** under Valdes.[3][5] Kokni replaces long-time executive **Richard Teyssier**, who is leaving the company after more than 14 years.[3][4]

Strategically, the shake-up comes as Puma is in a **“reset phase”** aiming to re-establish itself as a **top-three global sports brand** after a **10.4% year-over-year sales decline in Q3**, largely tied to its ongoing strategic overhaul.[3] New CEO **Arthur Hoeld** has criticized the brand for becoming **“too commercial”** in distribution, pricing and promotion, and has set **2027** as the target for returning to healthy growth.[3]

Kokni arrives from **Hugo Boss**, where she led **global marketing and communications** and was responsible for large-scale **brand transformation and digital acceleration**.[3][4][5] Her track record also spans **Adidas, JD Sports, Tommy Hilfiger and H&M**, giving her deep experience at the intersection of sport, fashion and lifestyle.[3][4][5]

## The Breakdown

### What Puma is really doing

Beneath the headline hire, Puma is executing a **structural bet** on brand-led growth:

- **Uniting product and brand in one power center**  
  Puma has collapsed **brand marketing, product, creative direction, innovation and go-to-market** into one global organization under a **Chief Brand Officer**, with Kokni as the top operational marketing leader.[3][5]  
  This is a shift away from siloed decision-making toward **single-threaded ownership** of the brand promise, product roadmap and market execution.

- **Installing a transformation specialist, not just a campaign leader**  
  Kokni is not just a creative marketer; she led **brand transformation and digital acceleration** at Hugo Boss and has repeatedly worked on reshaping global brands.[1][3][4][5]  
  For Puma, this signals a priority on **system-level change**—portfolio, positioning, channels and experience—not just better ads.

- **Linking storytelling directly to product icons and innovation**  
  Puma explicitly frames her mandate around "**sharpening storytelling around its product icons and innovation pipeline**" and bringing **product creation and storytelling even closer together**.[1][3][5]  
  The goal: translate R&D and design into **clear, differentiated narratives** that drive demand, pricing power and brand heat.

- **Course-correcting from over-commercialization**  
  CEO Arthur Hoeld has stated that Puma became **too commercial** in distribution, pricing and promotion.[3]  
  Consolidating brand and product under one leadership structure—and adding a leader with cultural and lifestyle experience—is an attempt to rebuild **desirability**, not just volume.

### Context: campaigns, performance and timeline

- In 2024, Puma launched its **largest global campaign to date**, "**Go Wild**", focused on the emotional "runner's high" with humorous, mass-appeal storytelling.[3]  
- Despite this, Puma’s **Q3 sales declined 10.4% year over year**, as the company entered a self-described **reset phase**.[3]  
- Management is signaling that this is a **multi-year turnaround**, with **2027** as the target to restore sustainable growth.[3]

In other words, Puma is acknowledging that **campaigns alone can’t fix structural brand drift**. The reorganization and Kokni’s appointment are about **aligning strategy, product and narrative** over several years.

## Why This Matters

For founders, CMOs and growth leaders, Puma’s moves highlight several strategic truths:

1. **Brand fragmentation kills momentum**  
   When product, brand, innovation and go-to-market live in different silos, you end up with **incoherent positioning**, scattered campaigns and weak pricing power. Puma’s choice to centralize these under one organization is a strong signal that **brand is an operating system, not a department**.[3][5]

2. **Desirability is a KPI, not a byproduct**  
   Hoeld’s critique that Puma became "too commercial" exposes a trap: chasing volume through aggressive distribution and discounting can **erode aspiration** and long-term equity.[3]  
   Puma is now explicitly investing in **brand heat, storytelling and icons**—exactly the levers that allow premium pricing and stickiness.[1][3][5]

3. **Transformation competence beats campaign fame**  
   Kokni’s resume is heavy on **turnaround and transformation** (Hugo Boss brand reset, digital acceleration) across sport, fashion and lifestyle.[1][3][4][5]  
   For any scaling company, the leaders you need are not just people who can "make things look good," but operators who know how to **re-architect positioning, portfolios and digital ecosystems**.

4. **Turnarounds are multi-year, not quarterly**  
   With a 2027 horizon for recovery, Puma is planning over a **3–4 year arc** rather than expecting instant impact from a single hire or campaign.[3]  
   Growth-minded entrepreneurs should take note: **category re-positioning and brand premiumization take cycles**, not sprints.

5. **Brand and performance marketing must converge**  
   Puma’s integrated structure recognizes that **upper-funnel storytelling and lower-funnel performance** must be orchestrated from one worldview. The same team defining the **brand narrative** is responsible for **how it shows up, where and to whom**.

## Action Plan

Here are concrete steps founders and marketing leaders can take, inspired by Puma’s playbook:

1. **Audit your org structure for brand–product misalignment**  
   - Map who owns **brand strategy, product roadmap, creative, innovation and go-to-market** in your company.  
   - Identify conflicting incentives or decision bottlenecks.  
   - Consider creating a single **accountable owner** (not necessarily a CBO, but at least a cross-functional leadership pod) for brand and product coherence.

2. **Define (or refresh) your core brand narrative around product "icons"**  
   - List your top 3–5 **hero products or services**.  
   - For each, craft a **simple, repeatable story**: who it is for, what unique outcome it delivers, and why it’s different.  
   - Build campaigns around these icons instead of spreading budget thin across everything.

3. **Rebalance away from "too commercial" tactics**  
   - Review discounts, promotions and channel partners from the last 12 months.  
   - Flag areas where **deep discounting or over-distribution** might be weakening your positioning.  
   - Design a 6–12 month plan to **tighten distribution, improve merchandising and elevate creative** in your highest-value channels.

4. **Install transformation talent, not just channel specialists**  
   - For your next senior marketing or growth hire, prioritize candidates who have led **cross-functional change** (repositioning, new category entries, digital overhaul).  
   - Give them an explicit mandate to **align brand, product and revenue strategy**, not just "run marketing".

5. **Set a realistic horizon for brand-led growth**  
   - For any major repositioning, define **12-, 24-, and 36-month milestones** (awareness, consideration, pricing power, mix of full-price sales).  
   - Communicate internally that **brand investments compound** and should be evaluated with different yardsticks than short-term promotions.

## Toolkit Recommendation

If Puma’s reset shows anything, it is that **guessing where demand will come from is too expensive**.

Instead of relying on gut feel or copying competitors, use tools that **quantify opportunity** before you commit resources.

A tool like **Micro Niche Finder** can:

- Analyze real market signals so you **stop guessing which niches work**.
- Help you identify **underserved, high-intent segments** where your brand can realistically create Puma-style "icons"—but on a smaller, more focused scale.
- Validate **positioning angles and sub-niches** in seconds, so your brand narrative, product roadmap and acquisition strategy are built on **data, not hunches**.

As you rethink your own brand architecture, use Micro Niche Finder to **stress-test markets and messages** before you reorganize teams, launch new lines or double down on a segment. That way, your version of a "Puma reset" is **aimed squarely at profitable, validated demand** rather than hope-driven experimentation.
