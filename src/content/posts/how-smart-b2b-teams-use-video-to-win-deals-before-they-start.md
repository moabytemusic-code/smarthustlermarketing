# B2B Video: Win Deals Before They Start

Smart B2B teams leverage a **three-play video strategy** to influence buyers early, with 86% pre-selecting vendors on Day 1.[snippet]

## The Situation

In competitive B2B markets, buyers move fast: **86% pre-select vendors on Day 1**, often before sales teams engage. Top teams counter this with targeted video content that reaches entire buying groups, builds trust, and drives demand gen. According to 2026 data, **91% of businesses use video marketing**, reporting higher win rates and shorter deal cycles.[1] This isn't hype—**85% of marketers say video directly generates leads**, and 83% report increased sales.[1]

## The Breakdown

The three-play strategy aligns videos to the buyer funnel:
- **Awareness**: Short-form explainers and thought leadership yield 60%+ completion rates and +129% engagement lift for cinematic narratives.[1]
- **Consideration**: Product demos and webinars boost landing page conversions by up to 80%; lead gen forms at the end of 60+ minute videos hit 65% conversion.[1][2]
- **Decision**: Personalized sales videos and case studies accelerate closes—personalized video emails get **3x more replies**, with AI tools like Vidyard's Video Sales Agent delivering 8x CTR and 4x reply rates.[1]

Key 2026 stats underscore the edge: **92% of businesses maintain or increase video budgets**, B2B video shortens deal cycles by 27%, and AI personalization drives 82% higher ROI.[1][2] Short-form video dominates, with 104% more marketers naming it top ROI channel.[4]

## Why This Matters

For business owners and marketers, video bridges the revenue gap: campaigns boost engagement, but only systematic video attribution ties it to pipeline—under 30% of marketers do this effectively.[1] In 2026, with **78% of B2B teams using video** and 50%+ increasing investment, ignoring it means losing ground. Video-influenced deals show higher win rates, directly impacting revenue amid pressure for short-term results.[1][4]

## Action Plan

1. **Audit and Map**: Inventory videos by funnel stage; set SMART goals like pipeline influenced and deal velocity. Most lack mid/bottom-funnel content.[1]
2. **Build the Three-Play**: Create awareness explainers, consideration demos, and decision personalized videos. Use AI for scale—51% of marketers already do.[1][2]
3. **Distribute via CRM Triggers**: Automate personalized sends on actions like demo bookings for 4x reply boosts.[1]
4. **Track ROI Rigorously**: Use CRM dashboards comparing video-influenced vs. non-influenced win rates; add UTM links.[1]
5. **Optimize with Benchmarks**: Aim for 60% completion (awareness), 80% conversion uplift (consideration), and velocity gains (decision).[1]
