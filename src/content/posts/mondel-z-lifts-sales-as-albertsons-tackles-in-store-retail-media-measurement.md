# Albertsons' In-Store Ads Deliver 14% Sales Lift: Mondelēz Case Study

## The Situation

Albertsons Media Collective, the retail media arm of Albertsons Companies, launched an **in-store digital display network** in June 2025, partnering with STRATACACHE for advanced screens in high-traffic areas like store entries and produce sections.[2][3] Mondelēz International served as a launch partner, promoting Sargento Cheese Bakes across 116 stores by integrating in-store screens with onsite and offsite media to boost household penetration and category growth.[1][3][4] Recently, Albertsons introduced a **matched market incrementality framework** to prove true causal sales impact, avoiding attribution of baseline sales.[3][5]

## The Breakdown

The Mondelēz campaign generated **over 5.5 million impressions**, a **1.5% conversion rate**, and a **14% in-store sales lift**.[3][4][5] It achieved a **$2.41 incremental return on ad spend (iROAS)** using store-level comparisons with nearly 60 variables to minimize bias.[1][3] Albertsons now has over 50 advertising partners, with plans to expand the network to 800 more stores across 10 divisions in 2026.[3][4] This addresses retail media challenges, as in-store ad spend is projected to exceed $1 billion by 2029.[3] Quotes from executives highlight precision: Albertsons' Liz Roche noted it "cuts through noise" for causal lift, while Mondelēz's Melissa Pitmon praised clear insights for optimization.[3][5]

## Why This Matters

For business owners and marketers, this validates **in-store media as a high-ROI channel** in an omnichannel world, proving incremental value beyond correlation.[3] CPG brands gain confidence in physical retail's role amid digital dominance, especially as US grocers lag European counterparts in screen networks and measurement.[4] Entrepreneurs can leverage similar tactics for precise attribution, scaling ad investments with data-backed proof, and tapping the "sleeping giant" of in-store retail media.[3]

## Action Plan

- **Audit your omnichannel mix**: Integrate in-store activations with digital media, targeting high-traffic moments like shelf decisions.[1][2]
- **Demand incrementality metrics**: Partner with retailers offering matched-market testing to isolate true sales lift from baseline purchases.[3]
- **Pilot small-scale campaigns**: Test in 100+ stores with clear KPIs like iROAS and impressions, mirroring Mondelēz's 116-store approach.[4]
- **Scale with expansion roadmaps**: Prioritize retailers like Albertsons planning 2026 growth for national reach across divisions.[3][7]
- **Track 60+ variables**: Use advanced frameworks to reduce bias and build advertiser confidence in causal impact.[3]

## Toolkit Recommendation

Stop guessing which niches or products drive retail sales. Use **Micro Niche Finder AI** to validate profitable markets in seconds, identifying high-potential CPG categories for in-store media dominance like Sargento Cheese Bakes.
