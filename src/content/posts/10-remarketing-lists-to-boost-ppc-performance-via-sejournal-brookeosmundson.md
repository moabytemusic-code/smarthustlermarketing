# 10 Remarketing Lists to Supercharge PPC ROI

## The Situation

A Search Engine Journal article highlights **10 remarketing lists** designed to transform first-party data into measurable PPC gains, focusing on practical account management over theory.[snippet] These lists target users based on behaviors like site visits, cart abandonment, and engagement, enabling precise re-engagement across platforms like Google Ads.[1][2][3]

Remarketing, often interchangeable with retargeting, re-engages warm audiences who have interacted with your brand, increasing conversions by reaching users already familiar with your offerings.[2][5]

## The Breakdown

Key remarketing lists and tactics include:
- **Website visitors and 'All Users' lists**: Start broad but segment using advanced filters like conditions (e.g., time on site >30 seconds) and sequences (e.g., visited pricing page after homepage) for higher intent.[3]
- **Cart abandoners and high-value page visitors**: Target users who reached checkout or product pages; these show strong purchase intent and warrant higher bids.[1][4][5]
- **Engaged users**: Filter by scroll depth, time on site, or key page views to exclude low-engagement bouncers.[8]
- **Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA)**: Bid higher on search for past visitors, boosting CTR and conversions with personalized copy for brand searches.[3][4][5]
- **Customer match and similar audiences**: Upload email lists for existing customers or lookalikes to expand reach.[1][2]
- **In-market and affinity audiences**: Layer with demographics for relevance.[1]

Optimization tips: Use frequency capping to prevent ad fatigue, adjust bids by segment (e.g., +50% for high-intent), test creatives, and segment campaigns tightly.[1][5] RLSA requires 1000 active users minimum.[5] Agencies report dramatic ROI lifts, like tens of thousands in revenue from refined lists.[2]

## Why This Matters

For business owners and entrepreneurs, these lists combat rising ad costs and privacy changes by leveraging **first-party data** for warmer leads at lower CPA.[7] Remarketing delivers higher ROAS—past visitors convert better than cold traffic—protecting budgets amid cookie deprecation.[2][5] Tight segmentation uncovers hidden performance, turning average PPC into a revenue engine, with potential for 2-3x conversion lifts via RLSA and intent signals.[3][4]

## Action Plan

1. **Audit existing lists**: Review Google Ads for broad 'All Users' lists; apply filters for engagement (e.g., >30s on site + key page visit).[3][8]
2. **Build 5 core segments**: Create lists for cart abandoners, product viewers, pricing page visitors, engaged scrollers, and RLSA for search.[1][3][5]
3. **Adjust bids and test**: Increase bids 20-50% for high-intent lists; A/B test ad copy with personalized offers.[4][5]
4. **Add negatives and cap frequency**: Block low-performers weekly; set 3-5 impressions/week per user.[1][5]
5. **Monitor and scale**: Use dashboards for real-time metrics; expand to lookalikes after 30 days of data.[2][5]
