Hey [Name],

If I lost everything today and had to start from scratch, I wouldn't panic.

I would just sign up for these 3 tools and be back in business by Friday.

**1. The "Home Base": Bluehost**
You need a website. Don't build on rented land (social media). Own your platform.

Email is where the money is. I use Brevo because it's free to start and scales with you.

### Day 7: Why I switched to Brevo
**Subject:** Why I fired Mailchimp...
**Body:**
Hey [Name],

I used to pay $200/month for email marketing.

Then I realized I was paying for "features" I never used.

I switched to **Brevo** and cut my bill by 80%.
*   Unlimited contacts (on the free plan!)
*   Better automation builder.
*   SMS marketing included.

If you're still overpaying for email, stop.
