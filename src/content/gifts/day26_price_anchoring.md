# Price Anchoring Guide ⚓️

**Goal:** Make your price look tiny.

## The Concept
If I tell you a watch costs $5,000, and then I offer it to you for $500, you think it's a steal.
If I tell you a watch costs $50, and I offer it to you for $500, you think it's a rip-off.
**Value is relative.**

## How to Stack Value (The "Stack")

**The Wrong Way:**
"Buy my course for $197."

**The Right Way (Anchoring):**
"Here is what you get:
1.  **The Video Course** (Value: $497)
2.  **The Template Library** (Value: $297)
3.  **The Private Community** (Value: $197)
4.  **Weekly Coaching Calls** (Value: $997)

**Total Value: $1,988**

But you aren't going to pay that.
You aren't even going to pay half.

**Today Only: $197**"

## Rules for Anchoring
1.  **Be Honest:** The "Value" must be real (what you would actually charge if sold separately).
2.  **Compare to Higher Costs:** Compare your product to the cost of *not* fixing the problem (e.g., "The cost of a divorce" vs "Our $100 relationship guide").
3.  **Visuals:** Cross out the old price visually ($̶1̶,̶0̶0̶0̶ $97).
