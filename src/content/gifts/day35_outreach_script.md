# Affiliate Manager Outreach Script 👔

**Goal:** Get a higher commission rate (bump from 30% to 50%) or a custom coupon code.

## The "Value First" Script

**Subject:** Collaboration with [Your Brand] (Sent 50 sales last month)

**Body:**
"Hi [Manager Name],

My name is [Your Name] from [Your Brand].
I've been promoting [Product] for 2 months and absolutely love it.
We've already sent about [Number] referrals your way.

I'm planning a big promotional push next month (email blast to 5k subs + YouTube review).
I want to make this my #1 recommended tool.

To help conversion, would it be possible to get:
1.  A custom coupon code for my audience? (e.g., HUSTLER20)
2.  A bump to [Percent]% commission for this campaign?

Let me know if we can work something out. I'm ready to scale this up.

Best,
[Your Name]"
