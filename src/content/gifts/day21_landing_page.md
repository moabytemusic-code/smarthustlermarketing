# High-Converting Landing Page Checklist ✅

**Goal:** Turn traffic into email subscribers. If your conversion rate is under 20%, fix this list.

## Above the Fold (The First 3 Seconds)
[ ] **The Headline:** Does it promise a specific result? (e.g., "Lose 10lbs" not "Get Healthy")
[ ] **The Sub-Headline:** Does it explain *how*? (e.g., "Without counting calories")
[ ] **The Visual:** Is there a clear image of the *thing* they are getting? (Ebook cover, Video thumbnail)
[ ] **The CTA Button:** Is it a contrasting color? (Red/Orange/Green)
[ ] **The CTA Text:** Is it action-oriented? (e.g., "Send me the Guide" not "Submit")

## The "Trust" Elements
[ ] **Social Proof:** Are there logos or testimonials?
[ ] **Authority:** "As seen on..." or "By [Your Name]"
[ ] **Privacy Policy:** Tiny link at the bottom (Required for ads).

## The Copy
[ ] **Bullet Points:** Do you list 3-5 benefits?
[ ] **Scarcity:** "Free for a limited time"?
[ ] **Simplicity:** Remove the navigation menu. There should be only ONE button to click.
