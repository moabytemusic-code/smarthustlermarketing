# The Micro-Niche Finder Worksheet 🎯

**Goal:** Stop competing with everyone. Find a profitable "sub-niche" where you can dominate.

## Step 1: The "Passion" Audit
List 3 things you are genuinely interested in (hobbies, skills, obsessions).
1.  __________________________
2.  __________________________
3.  __________________________

## Step 2: The "Drill Down" Method
Take your top interest and drill down 3 levels.
*   **Level 1 (Broad):** Fitness
*   **Level 2 (Specific):** Yoga
*   **Level 3 (Micro - THE GOLD MINE):** Yoga for men over 40 with back pain.

**Now you try:**
*   **Level 1:** __________________________
*   **Level 2:** __________________________
*   **Level 3:** __________________________ ( This is your niche! )

## Step 3: The "Profitability" Check
Before you commit, check if people are spending money here.
*(Check at least 2 boxes)*
[ ] Are there magazines/books on Amazon about this specific topic?
[ ] Are there YouTube channels with 50k+ subs dedicated to this?
[ ] Are there paid ads showing up on Google when you search this?

## Step 4: The Avatar Definition
Who exactly are you helping?
*   **Age/Gender:** __________________________
*   **Key Pain Point:** __________________________
*   **Desired Result:** __________________________
