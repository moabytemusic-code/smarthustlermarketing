# Funnel Map Diagram 🗺️

**Goal:** Visualizing the path from "Stranger" to "Customer".

## The "Simple Affiliate" Funnel

1.  **Traffic Source:** (TikTok / Pinterest / SEO)
    *   *Goal:* Get a click.
    *   *Metric:* CTR (Click Through Rate).

2.  **Opt-In Page (Squeeze Page):**
    *   *Offer:* Free Lead Magnet (The Gift).
    *   *Goal:* Get the Email Address.
    *   *Metric:* Opt-in Rate (Aim for 20-40%).

3.  **The Bridge Page:**
    *   *Content:* "Thank you + Introduction".
    *   *Goal:* Transfer Trust.
    *   *Metric:* Click to Offer (Aim for 20-30%).

4.  **The Affiliate Offer (External):**
    *   *Goal:* The Sale.
    *   *Metric:* Conversion Rate (Usually 1-3%).

5.  **The Email Sequence (Backend):**
    *   *Content:* Value + Logic + Scarcity.
    *   *Goal:* Recover the 98% who didn't buy immediately.

## Why this works
You own the email list (Asset). You don't own the traffic and you don't own the product. The list is the only thing you control.
