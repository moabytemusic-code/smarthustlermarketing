# Pinterest Traffic Guide (The Sleeping Giant) 📌

**Goal:** Get free, evergreen traffic that lasts for months (unlike TikTok, which dies in 24 hours).

## The Mindset Shift
Pinterest is NOT a social media. **It is a Visual Search Engine.**
Treat it like Google with pictures.

## The Strategy: "Fresh Pins"
Pinterest rewards *new* images. You don't need new blog posts, just new images pointing to the same post.

## Step 1: Keyword Research
Type your seed keyword into the Pinterest search bar.
Look at the suggested colored bubbles at the top.
*   *Example:* Search "Side Hustle". Bubbles say: "From Home", "For Moms", "No Money".
*   *Your Keyword:* "Side Hustles from home for moms".

## Step 2: The Pin Design (Vertical is Mandatory)
*   **Ratio:** 2:3 (1000px wide x 1500px tall).
*   **Headline:** Big, bold, easy to read on mobile.
*   **Image:** Aspirational. Show the *result* (cozy home office), not the process.

## Step 3: The "Sample" Pin Description
*Copy this structure:*

"Looking for the best **[Keyword]**? In this guide, I break down exactly how I made $1k this month using **[Method]**. This is the perfect **[Related Keyword]** for beginners. Click to read the full tutorial!"

## Step 4: The Idea Pin (Video)
Repurpose your TikToks to "Idea Pins". They get massive reach right now because Pinterest is trying to compete with TikTok.
**Do not** keep the TikTok watermark. Use a tool like SnapTik to remove it first.
