# The Spam Word Checker List 🚫

**Goal:** Avoid the "Promotions" tab and stay out of the Spam folder.

## The "Trigger" Words (Avoid in Subject Lines)
Email providers (Gmail, Outlook) scan for these words. If you use too many, you get flagged.

### Money / Financial
*   $$$
*   Cash
*   Credit
*   Income
*   Investment
*   Refinance
*   Mortgage
*   Earn
*   Work from home

### Salesy / Excessive
*   Buy
*   Directly
*   Click here
*   Order now
*   Bonus
*   Exclusive deal
*   Guarantee
*   Risk-free
*   Winner
*   Prize

### Urgency (Use sparingly)
*   Urgent
*   Now
*   Act immediately
*   Time sensitive
*   Offer expires
*   Last chance

## Best Practices
1.  **Don't SHOUT:** Avoid ALL CAPS in subject lines.
2.  **No excessive punctuation:** "Free Money!!!!" is a guaranteed spam flag.
3.  **Balance your ratio:** For every image, have at least a paragraph of text. Image-only emails often go to spam.
