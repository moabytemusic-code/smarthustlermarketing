# Competitor Analysis Template 🕵️‍♂️

**Goal:** Don't reinvent the wheel. Reverse engineer what is already working.

## Step 1: Identify the "Big 3"
Find 3 competitors who are exactly where you want to be in 2 years.
1.  **Competitor A:** __________________________
2.  **Competitor B:** __________________________
3.  **Competitor C:** __________________________

## Step 2: The Traffic Audit
Go to their website/socials and answer these 3 questions:
*   **Where is their traffic coming from?** (Examples: SEO, TikTok, Paid Ads, Email)
    *   *Comp A Source:* ________________
    *   *Comp B Source:* ________________
*   **What is their "Lead Magnet"?** (What do they give away for free?)
    *   *Comp A Gift:* ________________
    *   *Comp B Gift:* ________________
*   **What is their "Core Offer"?** (What is the expensive thing they sell?)
    *   *Comp A Offer:* ________________
    *   *Comp B Offer:* ________________

## Step 3: The Content Gap
Look at their most popular posts (highest views/likes).
*   **Topic 1:** __________________________
*   **Topic 2:** __________________________
*   **Topic 3:** __________________________

**The Gap:** What are they *not* talking about? Or what are they explaining poorly?
*   *My Opportunity:* __________________________
