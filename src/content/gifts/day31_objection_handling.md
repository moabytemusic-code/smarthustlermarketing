# Objection Handling Script 🛡️

**Goal:** Answer the "Why Not" before they even say it.

## The Big 3 Objections

### Objection 1: "I don't have the money."
**The Reframing Script:**
"I totally get it. It's an investment.
But let me ask you: How much is it costing you to *not* solve this problem?
If this course helps you convert just 1 extra client, it pays for itself.
The question isn't 'Cost', it's 'ROI'."

### Objection 2: "I don't have the time."
**The Reframing Script:**
"That is exactly *why* you need this.
You are busy because you are doing things manually.
This tool automates the process so you have *more* time.
Spend 2 hours setting it up today to save 20 hours next week."

### Objection 3: "Will this work for me?"
**The Reframing Script:**
"That's a fair question.
We have helped [Number] people just like you.
Here is a case study of [Name], who was in your exact situation.
And if it doesn't work? We have a 30-day money-back guarantee.
The risk is on me, not you."
