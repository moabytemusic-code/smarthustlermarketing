# The "Bridge Page" Script 🌉

**Goal:** Warm up traffic coming from social media before sending them to an affiliate offer.
**Why:** Facebook/TikTok hate direct affiliate links. Also, people don't buy from strangers.

## The Structure

### 1. The Headline (Hook)
"Wait! Before you go to [Product Name]..."
OR
"The exact tool I used to [Result]"

### 2. The Video (60 Seconds)
*   **Intro:** "Hey, it's [Name]. You clicked because you want [Result]."
*   **Value:** "I struggled with this for years until I found this solution."
*   **The Bridge:** "The next page is going to show you a video by [Expert/Product Creator] that explains exactly how it works."
*   **CTA:** "Click the button below to watch it. It's the same system I use."

### 3. The Button
"Continue to the Video >>"

### 4. Characteristics
*   Don't sell the product. Sell the *next step* (watching the sales video).
*   Keep it clean and simple. White background, black text.
*   Include a small "About Me" section at the bottom for trust.
