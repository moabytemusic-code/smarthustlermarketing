### [0:00 - 0:20] THE HOOK (Pattern Interrupt)

**(Visual: Shot of Influencer in a hammock with a laptop. A giant red "X" stamps over it, shattering the screen like glass.)**

**Narrator (Direct to Camera):**
"Stop. Trying. To. Be. Lazy."

"If I see one more guru tell you to simply 'upload a PDF' and retire to scrolling TikTok on a beach, I’m going to lose it. The 'Passive Income' dream you’ve been sold? It’s a lie. A mathematically impossible trap designed to keep you broke, distracted, and renting your life instead of owning it."

### [0:20 - 0:50] THE PROBLEM (The Race to the Bottom)

**(Visual: Quick montage of thousands of generic Etsy stores, AI-generated blog spam, and dropshipping sites.)**

**Narrator:**
"Here’s the cold hard truth: When a business model is 'easy' and 'passive', it means the barrier to entry is zero. And when the barrier is zero, competition is infinite."

"You are fighting against millions of other people—and now millions of AI bots—for pennies. You aren't building a business; you're feeding an algorithm that doesn't care if you starve. You’re building a sandcastle at low tide, and you’re wondering why the waves keep washing it away."

### [0:50 - 1:20] THE SOLUTION (Active Assets)

**(Visual: Shift to clean, premium aesthetic. Shots of blueprints, gears turning, equity dashboards.)**

**Narrator:**
"Real wealth... *Generational* wealth... isn't built by avoiding work. It's built by doing the hard work *once* to build a machine that works forever."

"Use your brain. We don't build 'passive income streams.' We build **Active Assets**."

"We build systems. We build equity. We build things that are hard to copy, expensive to replace, and impossible to ignore. We don't want 'mailbox money.' We want 'Exit Money.'"

### [1:20 - 1:45] THE OFFER (The Pivot)

**(Visual: 3D Render of "The Passive Trap" book slamming onto a desk. Two bonus icons pop up.)**

**Narrator:**
"I wrote a manifesto to break you out of the matrix. It’s called **'The Passive Trap'**."

"It’s not a 500-page textbook. It’s a tactical field manual that exposes the fake math of side hustles and gives you the blueprint for building *real* enterprise value."

"And because I want you to start building *today*, I’m throwing in two bonuses:
1. **The Asset Valuation Calculator:** See exactly what your 'hustle' is actually worth.
2. **The 'Anti-Passive' 30-Day Audit:** A checklist to strip the busy work out of your life."

### [1:45 - 2:00] THE CTA (Low Risk, High Reward)

**(Visual: Split screen. Left side: A fancy $7 latte. Right side: The Book cover.)**

**Narrator:**
"This book costs seven bucks. Less than that overpriced latte you’re holding that will be gone in 20 minutes."

"The coffee gives you a jittery buzz. This book gives you a future."

"Stop renting your income. Start building your empire. Click the button, grab the book, and let’s get to work."
