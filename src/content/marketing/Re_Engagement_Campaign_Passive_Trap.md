Hey {{ contact.FIRSTNAME }},

I’m going to be blunt.

If I see one more "guru" tell you to simply upload a PDF and retire to a beach, I’m going to scream.

The "Passive Income" dream you’ve been sold is a statistical lie. It’s a trap designed to keep you distracted, broke, and renting your life instead of owning it.

Real wealth isn't passive. It's **active**.

I wrote a short manifesto called **"The Passive Trap"** that explains exactly why most side hustles fail—and the one shift you need to make to build an asset that actually pays you.

I usually sell this as part of our bundle, but I want you to have it for free. No strings.

Read the first chapter. It might just save your year.

To your empire,

**Subject:** Did you catch this?

**Body:**
Hey {{ contact.FIRSTNAME }},

Just wanted to make sure you got the guide I sent over on Tuesday.

Most people download things and never read them. I don't want you to be "most people."

If you haven't opened **The Passive Trap** yet, start on **Page 5**.

It breaks down the "Equity vs. Income" equation that separates the hustlers from the business owners.

**[Download it here if you missed it]**

Let me know what you think.

Cheers,
