## Email 2: The Compass (Send 24 Hours Later)
**Subject:** Where to start first?

**Body:**

[Name],

You have a lot of firepower sitting on your hard drive right now. It can be overwhelming.

Here is my recommendation on where to attack first, depending on where you are:

**Option A: "I need to fix my brain first."**
If you are still struggling to pick a niche or you fee stuck in the "employee mindset," start with the book **"The Passive Trap."**
*   Read Chapter 1 tonight. It will shatter the "easy money" myths holding you back.

**Option B: "I am ready to build right now."**
If you have an idea and just need the tracks to run on, go straight to the **"Founder’s OS" Notion Template.**
*   Watch the setup video.
*   Fill out the "Quarterly Objectives."
*   Get your chaos organized.

**Option C: "I want the whole roadmap."**
Login to the **Active Asset Blueprint** course and watch the "Strategy Overview" in Module 1. It lays out the next 6 weeks of your life.

Don't try to do it all at once. Pick ONE path and execute.

Which one are you choosing?

## Email 3: The Engagement (Send 3 Days Later)
**Subject:** Quick question...

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I’m curious—now that you've had a few days to digest the material...

**What is your "Exit Number"?**

In the Blueprint, we talk about reverse-engineering your business from the day you sell it. Is your number $100k? $1M? $10M?

Hit reply with just the number. Even if it's just a guess right now.

Putting it in writing makes it real.

Talk soon,

- SH
