# Medium Import Procedure

This guide outlines the steps to import your existing blog posts to Medium using their official import tool. This method is preferred over copy-pasting because it automatically applies a **canonical link**, protecting your SEO by telling Google that your website is the original source of the content.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why use this tool?**
> When you use the Import tool, Medium adds a `rel="canonical"` tag referencing your original post. If you just copy/paste, Google might see duplicate content and split the ranking power. Always use the Import tool for reposting.

## Important Notes

*   **Canonical URLs:** Imported stories automatically apply a canonical URL referencing the original source. You can verify this by going to *Story Settings* > *Advanced Settings* in the Medium editor.
*   **Backdating:** The tool often backdates the post to the original publication date found in the metadata, keeping your timeline accurate.
*   **Permissions:** You may only import content from other sites for which you have the legal right to do so.
*   **Troubleshooting:** If the import tool is unable to process your post (which happens with some complex site structures), you may need to manually copy and paste. If you do this, you MUST manually set the canonical link in *Advanced Settings*.
