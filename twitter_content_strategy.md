# Twitter/X Content Strategy: The "Bolis Method"
**Goal**: Drive follows and DMs using social proof and recurring free offers.

## The Strategy
1.  **Social Proof**: Use screenshots of revenue (Stripe/Invoices) to stop the scroll.
2.  **The Pivot**: Connect the revenue to a specific "AI Side Hustle" (not just "content creation").
3.  **The Hook**: "Freelancers using AI earn 30% more" (Data-backed).
4.  **The Offer**: Time-limited free access to a guide/SOP in exchange for engagement.

## Implementation Notes
*   **Auto-DM Tool**: You will need a tool like Hypefury, Tweethunter, or ManyChat to automate the DMs.
*   **The Screenshot**: Ensure you have a clean, believable screenshot of earnings. If you don't have $6k/week yet, bundle multiple small wins or show "Client Savings" instead of revenue.
*   **The Offer**: Ensure the link you send captures their email (e.g., a landing page for the free resource). Don't just send a Google Doc link directly if you want to build your list.
